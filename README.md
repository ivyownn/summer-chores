# summer-chores

This project uses JavaScript to simulate a Saturday chore routine using **callback functions**. It models how someone might get tired and fall asleep before completing all their tasks.

## Overview

Each Saturday, a person goes through a specific list of chores in a set order. Every task takes a certain amount of time to complete, and after each one (except the first), thereâ€™s a chance they might fall asleep and stop working.

### Chore List

1. Mow the yard
2. Use the weed eater
3. Trim the hedges
4. Collect firewood
5. Water the garden

If the person manages to complete all tasks without falling asleep, a success message is displayed in the console.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Callback functions
- Timing with `setTimeout`
- Randomized behavior using `Math.random()`

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `callbackVersion.js` in your code editor.
3. Run the file in Node.js to simulate the chores:
   ```bash
   node callbackVersion.js
   ```
